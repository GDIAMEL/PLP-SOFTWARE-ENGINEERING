## ASSIGNMENT ONE
### 1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry

**Software Engineering**: Software engineering is the organized use of engineering concepts to plan, create, test, deploy, and keep up with software systems.

#### **Importance of Software Engineering in the Technology Industry**

Ensures High-Quality Software Development: This is because it utilizes structured methodologies such as Agile, DevOps, and Waterfall to ensure that the software is well-designed, efficient, and free from critical bugs.

Ensures Software Maintainability and Longevity: Proper documentation, testing, and version control allow software systems to be maintained and updated efficiently over time, reducing long-term operational issues.

Enhances Scalability and Performance: Through software engineering, systems that can handle increased loads without compromising speed or reliability are designed to cater to growing business needs.

Reduces Development Costs and Time: The best practices such as modular programming, version control through git, and automation help in cost reduction and overall reduce the time spent on fixing errors or rewriting code.

Improves Security and Data Protection: Through software engineering security measures like encryption, authentication, and secure coding practices are implemented to ensure users' data is protected and system integrity is enhanced in an era of cyber threats.

Drives Innovation and Technological Advancements: Through software engineering, cutting-edge technologies now exist, including AI, machine learning, blockchain, and the Internet of Things thus transforming industries like healthcare, finance, and manufacturing.

Supports Business Growth and Digital Transformation: Helps companies automate operations, improve customer experiences, and stay competitive in the digital age.

### 2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  

**Birth of Software Engineering (Late 1960s at a NATO Conference)**

Introduction of "Software Engineering" by Margaret Hamilton, Coined to address the Software Crisis while working on the Apollo guidance and navigation system. The focus was on Structured Programming and Modular Designs thus enhancing software development practices.

**Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (Late 1970s - Early 1980s)**

The shift from Procedural to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) occurred. In this, languages like C++ and Java spearheaded this transition. Code Reusability, Scalability, and Maintainability were improved by the OOP principles.

**Emergence of Agile Methodology (2001 - Agile Manifesto)**

This replaced the rigid Waterfall methods and emphasis on Collaboration, Adaptability, and Iterative Development.

### 3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

1. Requirement Analysis – Gathering and defining project requirements.


2. Planning – Creating a roadmap, budget, and timeline.


3. Design – Structuring the software architecture and UI/UX design.


4. Implementation (Coding) – Writing the actual software code.


5. Testing – Identifying and fixing bugs before deployment.


6. Deployment – Releasing the software to users.


7. Maintenance – Ongoing updates and improvements.
